## Admin Portal Production Readiness To-Do List

# High Priority Items
1. Replace Mock Data
- Replace hardcoded values in TransactionsChart ($237,650, +12.3%)
- Implement real churn data instead of calculating as 10% of revenue
- Ensure CommissionForecastChart uses real data from API

2. Complete API Implementation
- Finish the  recentTransactions implementation in the Edge Function
- Add pagination support for transaction data
- Implement proper filtering options for dashboard data

3. Fix Non-functional UI Elements
- Add click handlers to "View Detailed Report" button in TransactionsChart
- Implement functionality for "View Details" button in CommissionForecastChart
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper accessibility attributes

## Medium Priority Items
4. Improve Error Handling
- Implement React Error Boundaries around dashboard components
- Add more specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Implement retry logic for failed API requests

5. Optimize Performance
- Add proper caching strategies for dashboard data
- Implement data prefetching for commonly accessed information
- Consider code-splitting for large dashboard components

6. Fix TypeScript Issues
- Add proper Deno configuration for Edge Functions
- Ensure consistent typing across all components
- Remove any usage of any types where possible

### Low Priority Items
7. Enhance User Experience
- Add date range selectors for charts
- Implement export functionality for dashboard data
- Add tooltips for complex metrics to improve understanding

8. Improve Testing Coverage
- Add unit tests for critical components
- Implement integration tests for dashboard workflows
- Add end-to-end tests for critical admin functions

9. Documentation
- Document API endpoints and response formats
- Add inline comments for complex business logic
- Create user documentation for admin features

# Technical Debt
10. Code Refactoring
- Extract reusable chart components
- Standardize loading and error states across components
- Improve component composition to reduce duplication

11. Security Enhancements
- Audit admin permission checks
- Implement rate limiting for admin API endpoints
-Add logging for sensitive admin operations

# Final Checklist Before Production
- All mock data replaced with real API data
- All buttons and interactive elements are functional
- Loading, error, and empty states tested for all components
- Mobile responsiveness verified on multiple device sizes
- Performance tested with realistic data volumes
- Security review completed
- User acceptance testing completed
